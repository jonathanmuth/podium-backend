# Podium Backend

This is the first implementation of a potential backend for the Podium-App.
It is based on the commercial CMS Kirby <http://getkirby.com> and was implemented in a nightshift by Jonathan Muth.

In order to use this API in production you need to buy a Commercial License for Kirby. It can be obtained over at <http://getkirby.com/buy>.

## Running the API

To run the API all you need is a PHP server. For everyone's convenience I have included Node/Gulp config that will allow you to test the API locally.

Just follow these instructions

1. Download Node.js for your operating system and install it.
2. Run 'npm install' from the document root.
3. Type 'gulp' into your Terminal/Command Line and the site will open as soon as the PHP server is up and running.
4. Follow the instructions in the browser.
